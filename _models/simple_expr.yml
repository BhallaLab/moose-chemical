#           k1
#  a + b <-------> 2c
#           k11
#
#  and initial concentration of a = 1, b = 2, c = 0
#
#  Following expression describes the process.
#   
#   dc/dt = k1*(a0-c)(b0-c) + k11*(c0+x)(c0+x)
#
# The expression can only take one expression for each product (in this case c)
#
# Initial concentration of species can be used by suffixing it with #0 .
