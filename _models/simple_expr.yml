# This model the following reaction
#  a + b <-------> c,
#  and initial concentration of a = 1 and b = 2
#
#  Following expression describes the process.
#   
#   dc/dt = k11*a + k1*b
#
# Here the limitation is that this format can only take one, expression of each
# product.
#
# This should produce the similar result as of ./simple.yml 
#
# Initial concentration of species can be used by suffixing it with _init .
